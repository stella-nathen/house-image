# CSS House Illustration 🏠

This project was one of my first assignments for my **Intro to Web Development** course as an **Integrated Design and Media (IDM)** major at NYU. The goal was to create a static visual composition using only **HTML and CSS**, without images or JavaScript.

## About the Project

This piece is a stylized illustration of a house built entirely with HTML elements and CSS styling. Every part of the house — including the roof, windows, door, chimney, smoke, and ground — is created using `<div>` elements, positioning, gradients, borders, and shapes.

The project focuses on:
- Understanding CSS positioning (`relative`, `absolute`, `z-index`)
- Using flexbox for layout
- Creating shapes with borders and border-radius
- Layering elements to build a cohesive scene
- Experimenting with gradients and color for visual depth

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
  - Flexbox
  - Absolute positioning
  - Gradients
  - Z-index layering

## How It Works

The house is centered on the page using a flexbox container.  
Different sections of the house are layered using `position: absolute` and `z-index` values:
- The **main house** sits in front
- A **back house** adds depth
- The **roof**, **windows**, and **chimney** are built using CSS shapes
- Smoke is represented with circular divs stacked above the chimney
- The ground is a large rounded shape beneath the house

No images were used — everything is drawn with code.

## What I Learned

- How to break down a visual object into simple shapes
- How CSS positioning affects layout and layering
- How small design details (gradients, borders, proportions) improve visual quality
- How HTML and CSS can be used creatively beyond traditional layouts

## Future Improvements

- Add animations (e.g., moving smoke)
- Make the scene responsive
- Add interactivity with JavaScript
- Experiment with different environments or color themes
